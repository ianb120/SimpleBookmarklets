# SimpleBookmarklets

Simple collection of useful bookmarklets(bookmarks that run Javascript on the page). I've created these bookmarklets to help make testing webpages easier, cutting out the boring repetitive parts of my job.
These bookmarklets are small pieces of Javascript, the code appears on a single line and gets added to the URL field when creating a new bookmark.
